        "description": "### Summary\n\nCommonGen is a constrained text generation task, associated with a benchmark dataset, to explicitly test machines for the ability of generative commonsense reasoning. Given a set of common concepts; the task is to generate a coherent sentence describing an everyday scenario using these concepts.\n\nCommonGen is challenging because it inherently requires 1) relational reasoning using background commonsense knowledge, and 2) compositional generalization ability to work on unseen concept combinations. Our dataset, constructed through a combination of crowd-sourcing from AMT and existing caption corpora, consists of 30k concept-sets and 50k sentences in total.\n\n### Dataset Structure\n\nWe show detailed information for up to 5 configurations of the dataset.\n\n \n### Data Instances\n\n#### default\nAn example of 'train' looks as follows.\n\n```\n  {\n    \"concept_set_idx\": 0,\n    \"concepts\": [\"ski\", \"mountain\", \"skier\"],\n    \"target\": \"Three skiers are skiing on a snowy mountain.\"\n  }\n```\n\n### Data Fields\nThe data fields are the same among all splits.\n\n#### default\nconcept_set_idx: a int32 feature.\nconcepts: a list of string features.\ntarget: a string feature.\n\n#### Data Splits\nname    train    validation    test\ndefault    67389    4018    1497\nDataset Creation\nCuration Rationale\nMore Information Needed\n\nSource Data\nInitial Data Collection and Normalization\nMore Information Needed\n\nWho are the source language producers?\nMore Information Needed\n\n#### Annotations\n\nAnnotation process\nMore Information Needed\n\nWho are the annotators?\nMore Information Needed\n\nPersonal and Sensitive Information\nMore Information Needed\n\nConsiderations for Using the Data\nSocial Impact of Dataset\nMore Information Needed\n\nDiscussion of Biases\nMore Information Needed\n\nOther Known Limitations\nMore Information Needed\n\nAdditional Information\nDataset Curators\nMore Information Needed\n\nLicensing Information\nMore Information Needed\n\n\n### Citation Information \n\n```\n  @inproceedings{lin-etal-2020-commongen,\n      title = \"{C}ommon{G}en: A Constrained Text Generation Challenge for Generative Commonsense Reasoning\",\n      author = \"Lin, Bill Yuchen  and\n      Zhou, Wangchunshu  and\n      Shen, Ming  and\n      Zhou, Pei  and\n      Bhagavatula, Chandra  and\n      Choi, Yejin  and\n      Ren, Xiang\",\n      booktitle = \"Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020\",\n      month = nov,\n      year = \"2020\",\n      address = \"Online\",\n      publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n      url = \"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.165\",\n      doi = \"10.18653/v1/2020.findings-emnlp.165\",\n      pages = \"1823--1840\"\n  }\n\n```\nContributions\nThanks to @JetRunner, @yuchenlin, @thomwolf, @lhoestq for adding this dataset.",
